The title of this project is “Personal Finance Manager”. A Personal Finance Manager will help an individual person to track all kinds of financial activities of himself/herself. It will assist to monitor various types of activities like earning, spending and savings. The  user will inform the software about his day to day monitory activities. The system will store all the data given by the user and analyse the insights from it. It will also let the user know about the summary of his financial activities after certain intervals like week, month and year. It will also let the user know about his financial habits for a long time and help him to determine his financial advantages and disadvantages which might help the user to make a good economic plan for the future.

The project will be divided into three parts. They are-

1.	Earning sources: The user will inform the software about his earning sources and amounts. Sometimes it will be calculated automatically by the system with the data which are already given. The earning sources can be divided into several parts like:
    a. Efforts (Job/ Business)
    b. Investments (Share market)
    c. Allowance (Scholarship, stipend, pension etc) 

2.	Spendings: The user will inform the software about his spending criterias with their weights.
 I would like to divide all spendings in two categories. They are 
    i. Fixed: This type of expenses will NOT vary month to month. Example: Rent, food.
    ii. Non-fixed:  This type of expenses will vary month to month. Example: Shopping, gifts.
The system will analyse the cost ratio in these two types and help the user to maintain a balance between them.

3.	Savings:
The savings of the user will also be known to the system. It will include
    a. DPS
    b. Fixed Deposite
    c. Investments ect

Overall, the project aims at making a synchronisation among these three types of financial activities and help the user to maintain his date wise as well as monthly and annual finance management and analyse the financial advantages and liabilities of the user for both short and long terms.
